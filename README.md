# Watches
 
Run from main.cpp. The project's purpose is to demonstrate all concepts of OOP. It doesn't contain complicated funcionalities, the accent is on OOP concepts.
The goal: to model wathces. Wathces are products. Product can be selled, it has a price. It has different mechanisms and accessories (body, glass, bracelet, clasp). Products have price, and the receipt will depend on the product in question. Each product will be shown in a specific way. Mechanisms and accessories are also products. Three types of mechanisms: analogue, digital and mixed. Mixed watches should display only one time, despite the fact they have both analogue and digital mechanism.
Classes: Mechanism (analogue, digital, double), Watch, Accessory (body, bracelet...), Product.
